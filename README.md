# List Pagination and Filtering

Use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.
Starting with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. Write JavaScript 
to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

While making these improvements, use the principle of "progressive enhancement." The page should still display the students' names without JavaScript turned on, but will be much improved (enhanced) 
with the JavaScript programming you add.
